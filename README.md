### Malaria Detection Using MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)

### Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect malaria from cell images using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. The goal is to develop an efficient and accurate deep learning model that can automatically classify whether a given cell image is infected with malaria or not. The project leverages image data preprocessing, MLP architecture for classification, and various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model. <br>
The dataset used in this project consists of thousands of blood smear images labeled as either parasitized or uninfected. <br>
	•	Number of images: 27,558 images <br>
	•	Image size: 3-channel RGB images (130x130 pixels) <br>
	•	Classes: Parasitized (infected), Uninfected (not infected) <br>
 The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from Kaggle. <br>

### Results
After training, the MLP model achieves promising results in detecting malaria-infected cells. Key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ans mean squared error are reported to give a comprehensive view of the model’s performance. <br>
	•	Accuracy: 83% <br>
	•	Precision: 82% <br>
	•	Recall: 83% <br>
	•	F1-Score: 83% <br>
 	•	MSE: 0.17
